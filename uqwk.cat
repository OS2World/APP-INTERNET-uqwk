   NAME
     uqwk - Collect news and mail into packet for offline reading

   SYNOPSIS
     uqwk [options]

   DESCRIPTION
     uqwk is a program which collects all a user's unread mail or news and
     formats it into a packet for offline reading, saving telephone and con-
     nect charges.  QWK, Simple Offline Usenet Packet (SOUP), and ZipNews
     formats are supported.

     uqwk also accepts reply packets, so replies can be mailed or posted,
     depending whether the message is marked private (email) or public
     (news).

     uqwk also supports a small offline command language, so the contents of
     the user's .newsrc file can be viewed and manipulated offline.

   OPTIONS

     +m   Do mail.  uqwk will process all mail in the user's mail spool file
          and convert it into an offline packet.  This is the default.

     -m   Don't do mail.

     +n   Do news.  Using the user's .newsrc file and the news system's
          active file, uqwk will collect all unread news articles in all sub-
          scribed newsgroups into the packet.  This can generate a large
          number of messages and large packet files.

     -n   Don't do news.  This is the default.

     +h   Include headers.  Since the QWK specification places limits on the
          sizes of certain header fields such as To:, From:, and Subject:,
          uqwk can include all message and article headers in the body of the
          message so all fields are visible.  This is the default.  (This
          switch only applies to the QWK packet format.)

     -h   Do not include headers in messages.  (QWK only.)

     +e   Include an entry for every subscribed newsgroup in the CONTROL.DAT
          file.  (QWK only).

     -e   Do not include an entry in CONTROL.DAT for empty newsgroups.  This
          is the default.  (QWK only.)

     -p   Print options.  uqwk will examine all appropriate environment vari-
          ables and command line options, print the values of all run-time
          options, then exit.  This is useful to see what uqwk thinks it is
          going to do before you actually run it.

     +r   Read only.  Normally, uqwk will empty the user's mail spool file


                                                                            1






   UQWK(1)                                                   uqwk version 1.8


          and update the user's .newsrc file to reflect the fact that mail
          and news have been read.  If this switch is specified, uqwk will
          not touch these files.  This is useful for testing.

     -r   Do not execute in read-only mode.  This is the default.

     +L   Operate in SOUP (also known as HDPF or SLNP) mode.  The files
          comprising a Simple Offline Usenet Packet (SOUP), specifically,
          AREAS and *.MSG, will be created instead of a QWK packet.  The
          reply file, if any, will be interpreted as an SOUP "replies" file
          instead of a QWK reply packet.

     -L   Do not operate in SOUP mode.  This is the default.

     +z   Operate in ZipNews mode.  The files comprising a ZipNews news
          packet, specifically, "user.JN", "user.NWS", and "user.IDX", will
          be created instead of a QWK packet.

     -z   Do not operate in ZipNews mode.  This is the default.

     +x   Honor Xref header lines in news articles.  When this switch is in
          effect, uqwk will only pack a crossposted article in the first
          newsgroup in which it is encountered.  This can reduce the size of
          the packet but may introduce unexpected behavior on the part of the
          offline reader.

     -x   Do not honor Xref lines.  This is the default.

     +W   Activate the Blue Wave kludge.  The Blue Wave QWK reader does not
          like the personal.ndx file that uqwk creates by default.  If this
          switch is specified uqwk will create a regular ???.ndx file that
          Blue Wave likes.  (QWK only.)

     -W   Do not activate the Blue Wave kludge.  This is the default.

     +X   Operate in expert QWK mode.  The QWK header is ignored and all
          header lines are taken from the body of the message.  In the hands
          of an expert, this permits the creation of RFC822 compliant mail
          messages and RFC1036 compliant news articles using QWK readers,
          which is difficult or impossible otherwise in many cases.  This is
          intended for people who really know what they're doing.  (QWK
          only.)

     -X   Do not operate in expert QWK mode.  This is the default.

     -M_m_a_i_l_d_i_r
          Look in the directory _m_a_i_l_d_i_r for the mail spool file.  The default
          is /usr/spool/mail.

     -f_m_a_i_l_f_i_l_e
          Look for mail in the file _m_a_i_l_f_i_l_e.  The default is a file with the
          same name as the user's login name in _m_a_i_l_d_i_r.  This switch over-
          rides the -M switch.

   uqwk version 1.8                                                   UQWK(1)


     -u_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
          By default uqwk uses the getpwuid() system call to determine the
          proper user name to use.  This switch overrides the results of that
          call.

     -H_h_o_m_e_d_i_r
          By default, uqwk uses the getpwuid() system call to determine the
          user's home directory.  The home directory is where the files
          comprising the offline packet will be created.  It is also where
          uqwk looks for the .newsrc file.  This switch may be used to over-
          ride the results of the getpwuid() call.

     -b_b_b_s_n_a_m_e
          Specify the BBS Name to be entered into the QWK packet.  The
          default is "unknown BBS".  (QWK only.)

     -c_c_i_t_y
          Specify the BBS City to be entered into the QWK packet.  The
          default is "Anytown, USA".  (QWK only.)

     -P_p_h_o_n_e
          Specify the BBS Phone Number to be entered into the QWK packet.
          The default is "555-1212".  (QWK only.)

     -s_s_y_s_o_p
          Specify the BBS Sysop Name to be entered into the QWK packet.  The
          default is "Joe Sysop".  (QWK only.)

     -i_b_b_s_i_d
          Specify the BBS ID to be entered into the QWK packet.  The BBS ID
          is important since it will be checked against the BBS ID string in
          any incoming reply packets.  If the two do not match, the reply
          packet will not be processed.  The BBS ID consists of an integer, a
          comma, and a string of less than nine characters, with no spaces.
          The default is "0,SOMEBBS".  (QWK only.)

     -a_a_c_t_i_v_e_f_i_l_e
          Use _a_c_t_i_v_e_f_i_l_e for the list of all available newsgroups and article
          numbers.  The default is /usr/lib/news/active.  This option is
          ignored if articles are being obtained from a news server using
          NNTP.

     -N_n_e_w_s_r_c_f_i_l_e
          Use _n_e_w_s_r_c_f_i_l_e for the list of all newsgroups to which the user is
          subscribed and the list of article numbers which have been read.
          The default is a file called ".newsrc" in the user's home direc-
          tory.

     +w   Interpret the _n_e_w_s_r_c_f_i_l_e as a Waffle "join" file instead of a regu-
          lar Unix .newsrc.

     -w   Do not interpret the _n_e_w_s_r_c_f_i_l_e as a Waffle "join" file.  This is
          the default.



                                                                            3






   UQWK(1)                                                   uqwk version 1.8


     -D_n_g_f_i_l_e
          Process newsgroups in the order specified in _n_g_f_i_l_e.  _n_g_f_i_l_e is
          expected to contain one newsgroup name per line.

     -S_n_e_w_s_d_i_r
          Look for news articles in the directory _n_e_w_s_d_i_r.  The default is
          /usr/spool/news.  This option is ignored if articles are being
          obtained from a news server using NNTP.

     -B_m_a_x_b_l_o_c_k_s
          Stop processing news articles if the size of the offline packet
          exceeds _m_a_x_b_l_o_c_k_s 128-byte blocks.  This is useful since large
          amounts of unread news can create large packets.  Use a _m_a_x_b_l_o_c_k_s
          value of zero to suppress this check.  The default is 4000 blocks
          (half a megabyte).

     -t_t_a_b_l_e_f_i_l_e
          Translate newsgroup names as specified in _t_a_b_l_e_f_i_l_e.  Each line in
          _t_a_b_l_e_f_i_l_e is expected to have two fields separated by white space:
          The old name of the newsgroup and the name to which it will be
          translated.  (QWK only.)

     -l_l_e_n
          Truncate the names of newsgroups to _l_e_n characters.  Some offline
          readers cannot handle long newsgroup names.  Newsgroup names are
          truncated after having been translated.  The default is 15 charac-
          ters.  Specify a value of zero for unlimited newsgroup name
          lengths.  (QWK only.)

     -R_r_e_p_l_y_f_i_l_e
          Process _r_e_p_l_y_f_i_l_e as a reply packet.  Messages and articles created
          by the offline reader must be uploaded as a reply packet and then
          processed by this switch to be mailed or posted.  If operating in
          SOUP mode, this file should be the REPLIES file.  uqwk will remove
          _r_e_p_l_y_f_i_l_e when it has been processed unless it is running in read-
          only mode.  If operating in ZipNews mode, this switch should
          specify the directory in which the ZipNews reply files reside.

     -d_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
          Use the specified _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e when processing ZipNews reply packets.
          This should be the fully-qualified domain name of the Unix host.
          The default is "nowhere".

     -U_s_u_m_f_i_l_e
          Operate in "summary" mode.  Instead of packing articles, uqwk
          creates a summary file, _s_u_m_f_i_l_e, which consists of the newsgroup
          name, article number, and subject line of each unread article.  All
          summarized articles are marked as read.

     -E_s_e_l_f_i_l_e
          Operate in "selection" mode.  Instead of using the .newsrc file to
          determine which articles to pack, uqwk reads _s_e_l_f_i_l_e, a file in the
          same format as the summary file.  (The actual subjects are optional
          in _s_e_l_f_i_l_e.)  The idea is that a summary may be created by using

          -U, downloaded, edited or processed by additional software to
          select desired articles, uploaded, and fed to the -E switch for
          offline article selection.

     Most of the run-time options can also be controlled by environment vari-
     ables.  If an option is specified by both an environment variable and a
     command-line option, the command-line option is honored.

     UQ_PRT_OPTS
          Determines whether or not to just print the values of run-time
          options and stop.  Should be set to "1" (print options) or "0"
          (don't print options).

     UQ_READ_ONLY
          Determines whether or not to run in read-only mode.  Should be set
          to "1" (read-only) or "0" (not read-only).

     UQ_WAF_MODE
          Determines whether the .newsrc file should be interpreted as a Waf-
          fle "join" file.  Should be set to "0" (normal) or "1" (Waffle
          mode).

     UQ_SOUP_MODE
          Determines whether or not to run in SOUP mode.  Should be set to
          "0" (don't run in SOUP mode) or "1" (run in SOUP mode).

     UQ_ZIP_MODE
          Determines whether or not to run in ZipNews mode.  Should be set to
          "0" (don't run in ZipNews mode) or "1" (run in ZipNews mode).

     UQ_XRF_MODE
          Determines whether or not to honor Xref lines.  Should be set to
          "0" (do not honor Xref lines) or "1" (honor Xref lines).

     UQ_BW_KLUDGE
          Determines whether or not to activate the Blue Wave kludge.  Should
          be set to "0" (do not activate the Blue Wave kludge) or "1"


                                                                            5

          Specifies the name of the reply packet, if any.

     UQ_HOST_NAME
          Specifies the host name for ZipNews replies.

     UQ_SUM_FILE
          Specifies the name of the summary file, if any.  Also causes uqwk
          to execute in summary mode.

     UQ_SEL_FILE
          Specifies the name of the selection file, if any.  Also causes uqwk
          to execute in selection mode.

   COMMAND LANGUAGE
     If, while processing a reply packet, uqwk encounters a message to the
     username "UQWK", the body of the message will be interpreted as a small
     command language, used to display newsgroup names and subscribe or
     unsubscribe to newsgroups.  The results of the execution of the commands
     will be mailed back to the originating user.

     This is what the command language looks like:

     HELP List all the available commands.

     SUBSCRIBE newsgroup
          Subscribe to the named newsgroup.

     UNSUBSCRIBE newsgroup
          Unsubscribe from the named newsgroup.  UNSUBSCRIBE ALL may be used
          to unsubscribe from all newsgroups.  UNSUBSCRIBE ALL is also the
          only way to create a new .newsrc if it does not already exist.

     CATCHUP newsgroup
          Mark all articles in the named newsgroup as read.

     GROUPS
          List all newsgroups to which the user is currently subscribed.

     ALLGROUPS
          List all the available newsgroups and the number of articles in
          each one.

     SHELL command
          Execute the specified shell command.  Anything written to standard
          output will be mailed back to the originating user.

   NOTES
     In QWK mode, it is possible to send mail to long email addresses by
     including, as the first thing in the body of the message, a line of the
     form:

                                To: user@site.com




                                                                            7






   UQWK(1)                                                   uqwk version 1.8


     (The space after the colon is important.)

   BUGS

     The handling of MMDF mail files is kludgy and should be fixed.

     In QWK mode, if the .newsrc file is modified significantly between the
     time a packet is created and the time replies to that packet are pro-
     cessed, it is possible that articles may be posted to the wrong news-
     group.  If you use uqwk along with a conventional online newsreader, it
     may be wise to maintain a separate .newsrc file strictly for uqwk.

     uqwk does not do mail locking.  If new mail arrives while uqwk is pack-
     ing mail, the new message may be lost.  If you're worried about this,
     either make a copy of your mail spool before running uqwk, or run uqwk
     in read-only mode and erase your mail spool manually when you think it
     is safe.

     uqwk does not support the ZipNews offline commands.  To perform offline
     configuration using uqwk, send mail to the username "UQWK" in the format
     described in the COMMAND LANGUAGE section above.
